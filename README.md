## Requirements

In order to run the software you will need both [Obspy](https://docs.obspy.org/)(I have version 1.2.2) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)(I have version 1.14.0).  I recommend creating a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment and installing both packages into it.
